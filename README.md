# CRCH-1 

# Project Overview
CRCH-1 is a compact, high-performance robotics control hub designed specifically for competition robots. It integrates a powerful microcontroller, precision IMU, multiple motor and sensor ports, and stable power management into a single lightweight PCB to provide flexible, reliable, robot control.

# Why?
After competing in WRO Robomission Senior and placing 7th globally, I realized that the limitations of LEGO Spike Prime, especially the port count and constant gyro drift which the restricted robots flexibility. CRCH-1 was created to overcome these limitations by giving future robots more connectivity, superior flexibility and higher consistency enabling us to compete at the highest level.
